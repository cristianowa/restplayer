An seemless http remote player.

Pre-requisites:

python-vlc flask

$ sudo pip install python-vlc flask

## Why ?

How do you play music on your raspberry pi without controlling it ?
That is the question that we searched for.
The MDP (http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients#Web_Clients)
is an alternative, but it requires too many stuff to work.
Also controlling VLC via remote desktop, using command line
tools via SSH or installing a XMBC is, or too complicated for daily use,
or an overkill solution.
This question  http://superuser.com/questions/138574/controlling-music-player-from-web
have some answers, but all of them need an workaround or the instalation and configuration.

## What we want to do ?

Install one package and be able to play music (and maybe video) from local files and URLs.
Addicionally, add new media files may be added.

How we want to do ?
Providing a RESTful interface for playing, pause, stoping and all other player related actions,
altogether with the upload of files and configuration issues.
For the backend we will use the vlc bindings for python and the flask for the framework.
We will also provide a html5 player for remote control using just a browser.
